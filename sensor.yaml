    # Description: Indicates the overall direction of power flow with the utility grid. When 1, the system is sending power out to the grid (exporting); when 0, the system is pulling power in from the grid (importing). For example, 1 would correspond to times when solar/battery surplus is feeding into the grid.

    # Description: The magnitude of instantaneous power exchange with the grid. This value represents the amount of power either drawn from or sent to the grid. Use the Grid Direction sensor to determine direction (import vs export). For example, a reading of 400 W with Grid Direction = 1 means 400 W is being exported to the grid; if Grid Direction = 0, 400 W would be imported from the grid.

    # Units: Watts (W). Value type: number.
    # Description: Net power flowing into or out of the battery system (possibly at the inverter AC connection). This may reflect the battery’s overall charge/discharge rate. In practice, this might mirror the Battery Power value for discharging, and could be zero or negative when charging. (If negative values are used by the API, negative would indicate charging power flowing into the battery).

    # Mappings: 0 = Input mode (system absorbing power), 1 = Output mode (system supplying power).
    # Description: A high-level indicator of whether the battery system is outputting power to the home/grid (1) or not (0). This could be interpreted as 1 when the system is in discharge mode (providing power to loads or grid), and 0 when the system is in net charge mode (absorbing power, e.g., charging the battery).
